It started, as it always did, with water.

Not the gentle kind that lapped against the shore, nor the kind that danced in fountains beneath city lights. No, this was the sea in its rawest form—ancient, unbreakable, infinite. The tides moved to his will, the storms called him brother, and the deepest trenches of the ocean whispered his name in currents older than Olympus itself.

Percy Jackson.

A name spoken in reverence. A name cursed by gods and monsters alike. A name that should not have mattered—just another demigod among thousands, another child left to fate’s cruel whim. But fate had never been in control, not truly. Because Percy had been born to defy it.

The world had tried to shape him—into a pawn, a soldier, a hero. He had been forced to fight wars he never wanted, to bear the weight of a legacy he had never asked for. He had watched friends die, watched the gods turn their backs, watched the line between right and wrong blur into something unrecognizable. And still, he had stood.

Not for Olympus. Not for the glory of half-bloods. But for them.

The ones who had no prophecies to their name. The ones whose battles would never be sung in myths. The ones who lived in the shadows of a world that barely acknowledged their existence.

Demigods. Forgotten, hunted, abandoned.

They had called him a hero. A son of Poseidon. A savior. But they had never understood. Percy Jackson was not just one demigod. He was all of them. The boy who had lived in fear of monsters under his bed, just like the rest of them. The outcast who had learned, too young, that survival was a privilege. The fighter who had taken every cut, every scar, every betrayal, and turned it into something unbreakable.

The gods had never ruled the demigods. The camps had never united them. But Percy had. Not through power, nor through fear, but through something far more dangerous.

Loyalty.

It burned in his veins like ichor, an unshakable truth that Olympus had never understood. He would not kneel. He would not bow. Not to prophecy, not to destiny, not even to the sea itself. His fate was his own.

And when the tides rose, when the heavens cracked and the world held its breath, it was not Olympus they looked to.

It was him.

The son of Poseidon. The storm that defied the sky. The king of the forgotten.

Percy Jackson.

## Disillusioned Hearts

The world is not what Harry Potter once believed. Shackled by unseen compulsions and manipulated from the shadows, he begins to unravel the truth—not just about himself, but about the legacy he carries. Ancient magics stir in his blood, secrets buried beneath centuries of silence, and forces far beyond wizardkind take notice as he strays from the path carved out for him. But Harry is done playing the role others have written for him.

What if he thought deeper, acted sharper? What if he refused to be a pawn, turning his mind and magic into weapons of his own making? This is not the naïve boy who once longed for acceptance. He is a political savant, a master of the unseen war, reshaping the world to his will and forging the family he always deserved.

Harry Potter is no longer just a boy with a scar. He is a threat. A harbinger. And the world is not ready for what he is becoming.

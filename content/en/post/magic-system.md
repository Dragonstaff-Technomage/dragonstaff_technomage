The Harry Potter universe screwed itself right out of the gate by combining the softest of soft magic with setting the entire thing in a _school_ for _teaching_ the protagonist _how magic worked_, and rather than having to establish hard rules on a soft magic system so it _could_ let magic do its job, it split the difference by making Harry such a terrible student that neither he nor the audience ever learns anything about how magic actually works. Hermione does hif homework for him. He cheats off Snape's old textbook. He starts and ends the series with the _same spell_ because it's poetic and also becuase to do anything else would've required letting him actually _learn_ or _grow_.

We are given single disconnected data points that smack of hard magic systems - individual magic words with static, concrete consequences and limitations, `Accio` not working on living creatures, etc - and the implicatio that, elsewhere in the universe, smarter people than Harry are capable of developing _new_ spells. This _implies_ that there is a system of rules at play here. Mispronouncing a spell or changing the associated wand movement can cause it to have a different effect, meaning the words have power on their own. Yet wordless magic exists for the same spells: `silent casting`.

Is there a language of magic? Well, yes, and it's Latin, but like - is there a _reason_ these sounds produce these effects? In other systems magic is the language of _dragons_, or the _true names_ of the souls of the elements and creatures of the world. No such explanantion is given here. Spells misfire or are miscast by incompetent wizards or broken wands, resulting in intriguing consequences outside the typical spell parameters, implying an intriguing fluidity to magic that is bellied by literally everythhing we're shown or told. Before going to Hogwarts, Harry causes inexplicable phenomena (vanishing glass, hair growing overnight, the world generally warping in small ways to help him out) that is heavily implied to be the result of his magic because _what else could it be_, but after going to Hogwarts, we never see this sort of wild maic, which is a shame, because it seems like it could've been useful.

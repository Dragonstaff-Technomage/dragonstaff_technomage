The Hugo Brewm theme allows you to easily configure your site's logo. Follow these steps to set up your logo:

## Adding Logo Image / Logomark Icon

> Prepare your logo image
>
> - Create or prepare your logo image file (recommended formats: PNG or SVG)
> - For best results, use an image with a transparent background
> - Recommended dimensions: height of 50px to 70px
> - You can also add dark mode version of your logo

Configure the logo in your site configuration:

```toml
[params]
    logoMark = 'https://example.com/logoMark.svg' 
    logoMarkDark = 'https://example.com/logoMarkDark.svg' #optional
```

## Using Logo Type Preset

If you prefer not to use an image logo, you can enable the built-in text-based logo by adding this setting:

```toml
[params]
    logoType = true
```

After making these changes, rebuild your site to see the updated logo. The logo will automatically appear in the site's header and will be responsive across different device sizes.

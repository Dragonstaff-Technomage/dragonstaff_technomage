## About Us

Enter Dragonstaff and Technomage, lifelong fanfiction connoisseurs who've binged on more fictional worlds than they can count. Finally summoning the bravery (or sheer audacity), they dive into the wild world of fanfic creation. Armed with a shared love for storytelling and a questionable amount of caffeine, they embark on a quest to spin tales that'll make readers laugh, cry, and wonder why they haven't done this sooner. As they navigate the perilous seas of plot twists and character arcs, Dragonstaff and Technomage discover the joy of being both puppeteers and enthusiastic fans, turning their teenage dream into a hilarious reality. Get ready for an adventure where fandom meets tomfoolery, and where the line between creating chaos and creating fanfiction becomes deliciously blurry.
